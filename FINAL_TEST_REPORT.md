## Bug Fix Verification

### P0 Issue: Markets Not Displaying - ✅ RESOLVED

**Before Fix:**
- Markets list was completely empty
- Error: "TypeError: raw is not iterable" in useMarketsQuery
- MarketList component rendered but showed no cards
- Users could not place bets
- Impact: BLOCKING - Core functionality unusable

**Root Cause Identified:**
The bug was in `/src/hooks/useMarkets.ts` at lines 48-56. The code was attempting to destructure the MarketView struct as an array using spread operator:
```typescript
// BROKEN CODE:
const [marketId, outcomeCount, startTime, lockTime, settled] = raw;
```

However, the Solidity struct returns an object, not an array. This caused the "TypeError: raw is not iterable" error.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed market data parsing from array destructuring to object property access:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
const marketId = raw.marketId;
const outcomeCount = raw.outcomeCount;
const startTime = raw.startTime;
const lockTime = raw.lockTime;
const settled = raw.settled;
```

Additionally:
- Added proper TypeScript types for MarketView struct
- Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the query flow
- Added empty state UI handling
- Improved error handling

**After Fix - Verification Results:**

✅ **All 3 Markets Now Display Correctly:**
- Market #1001: Visible, 3 encrypted outcomes
- Market #1002: Visible, 3 encrypted outcomes
- Market #1003: Visible, 2 encrypted outcomes

✅ **Market Selection Works:**
- Clicking Market #1001: Bet slip updates correctly
- Clicking Market #1002: Bet slip updates, shows 3 outcomes (Team A, Team B, Draw)
- Clicking Market #1003: Bet slip updates, shows 2 outcomes (Team A, Team B only)

✅ **Data Flow Confirmed:**
- Console logs show: `[useMarketsQuery] Market IDs from contract: [1001n, 1002n, 1003n]`
- Each market's raw data logged with correct structure
- Final processed markets: `[Object, Object, Object]`
- All market properties correctly parsed and displayed

✅ **UI Components Functional:**
- Market cards render with proper styling
- Status badges show "Open"
- Start/lock times display correctly
- Pool and payout ratio show "0.000 ETH" and "0.00x" (expected for new markets)

**Screenshots Evidence:**
- Before: See E2E_TEST_REPORT.md screenshots 02, 05 (empty market area)
- After:
  - `final_dapp_initial_state.png` - All 3 markets visible
  - `final_market_1002_selected.png` - Market #1002 selected with 3 outcomes
  - `final_market_1003_selected_2outcomes.png` - Market #1003 selected with 2 outcomes
  - `final_dapp_complete_view.png` - Final complete DApp view
