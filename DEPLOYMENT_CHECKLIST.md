## Risk Assessment

### High Risk: 0 ‚úÖ
No high-risk items identified.

### Medium Risk: 1 ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Wallet Connection Issues**

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Contract deployment fails
- Check deployer has enough Sepolia ETH
- Verify PRIVATE_KEY is correct
- Check Sepolia RPC is accessible

**Issue**: Frontend can't connect to contract
- Verify VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS is set
- Check contract is deployed
- Verify network is Sepolia

**Issue**: Wallet won't connect
- Check browser supports WalletConnect
- Verify CORS headers are set
- Try different wallet provider
