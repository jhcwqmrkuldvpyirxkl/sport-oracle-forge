## Conclusion

The SportOracle DApp demonstrates a solid foundation with excellent UI/UX design, proper navigation, and wallet integration. However, the **critical issue of markets not displaying** renders the core betting functionality unusable in its current state.

### Priority Actions:

1. Fix market display immediately (BLOCKING)
2. Configure proper WalletConnect projectId
3. Resolve COEP header conflicts
4. Clean up console errors

### Readiness Assessment:

- **Development:** READY (with bug fixes)
- **Staging:** NOT READY (critical bug blocks testing)
- **Production:** NOT READY (must fix all P0/P1 issues)

### Next Steps:

1. Debug and fix market display issue
2. Re-run E2E tests after fixes
3. Conduct cross-browser testing
4. Perform security audit
5. Load testing with multiple concurrent users

**Report Generated:** 2025-10-29
**Testing Tool:** Playwright MCP
**Test Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Screenshots Location:** `/Users/lishuai/Documents/crypto/zama-developer-program/.playwright-mcp/`

**QA Engineer Notes:**
This is a comprehensive automated E2E test. Manual exploratory testing is still recommended to uncover edge cases and usability issues not covered by automated tests. Special attention should be paid to the encrypted betting flow once the market display issue is resolved.
